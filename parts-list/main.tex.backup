\section{Introduction}

Harvested plant tissues represent an under-explored frontier for biotechnology. Despite being detached from the parent plant, they remain metabolically active, maintaining the transcriptional and enzymatic capacity required for complex biosynthesis. Recent efforts in plant synthetic biology have successfully engineered autonomous regulation using endogenous signal sensing during the plant growth phase. For example, \citet{Ge2018} designed synthetic Abscisic Acid (ABA)-responsive promoters (Ap, Dp and ANDp) to drive the expression of ABA-signalling genes such as CARK1 and RCAR11. Similar approaches have demonstrated programmable ligand sensing via synthetic histidine-kinase signalling pathways and jasmonate-responsive activation of defence metabolite production.

We aimed to extend this paradigm into the post-ripening phase. This allows us to engineer valuable compounds like peptides, vitamins, small-molecule drugs, etc. which is less-dependent on external inputs that are highly variable during the growth phase of plants. To achieve robust post-harvest control, we identified two hormones with a unique regulatory relationship:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Ethylene: This hormone functions as the master transcriptional regulator of fruit ripening. It activates large transcription factor networks controlling cell wall remodelling, sugar metabolism, and volatile production. Critically, ethylene levels increase dramatically — often by orders of magnitude — following harvest. This transition reflects a regulatory switch from autoinhibitory basal synthesis to autocatalytic positive feedback, creating a sharp and reliable temporal signal marking entry into the ripening phase.
    \item Gibberellins: In contrast, gibberellins act as master regulators of fruit growth and developmental expansion programs. Gibberellin signalling declines substantially as fruit transitions from growth to ripening. Importantly, reduced gibberellin signalling can promote ethylene biosynthesis, while ethylene signalling does not directly restore gibberellin levels.
\end{itemize}

To exploit this, we developed iCIDER, a synthetic biology platform that converts endogenous post-harvest ethylene-gibberellin dynamics into programmable gene expression outputs. At the core of iCIDER is a NIMPLY logic gate, where expression is activated only when ethylene is present and gibberellin is absent. This architecture enables temporal filtering of expression such that gene activation occurs only once tissues have fully transitioned into the post-harvest ripening state. By tuning circuit parameters such as repressor binding affinity and degradation rate, we achieve control over both the magnitude and duration of expression, generating a transient post-harvest pulse of gene activity.

As a proof of concept, we applied iCIDER to regulate pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) and alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (ADH1), driving ethanol production in apples. Ethanol biosynthesis was selected because it is a two-step pathway drawing directly from central carbon metabolism, minimizing metabolic burden relative to more complex secondary metabolite pathways. The modular architecture of iCIDER allows straightforward replacement of output cassettes and incorporation of additional or inverted sensing modules, positioning this framework as a general strategy for programmable post-harvest traits in agriculture.

    \label{fig:circuit-overview}
\end{figure}

The circuit has four modules (Figure 1): the plant hormone (phytohormone) sensor in the form of a NIMPLY gate; the activation module drives strong biosynthesis of the cassette; the repression module stops the circuit; and the cassette module. Currently, temporal dynamics are cassette-dependent and adjusting the activation-repression delay remains a limitation.

\subsection{Phytohormone Sensor}

For our proof of concept, we aimed to express PDC and ADH1 for ethanol biosynthesis post-harvest by exploiting the endogenous fruit ripening mechanism. We decided on ET as it is the most studied phytohormone regulating ripening in climacteric fruit, including apples \citep{Liu2015,Zenoni2023}. Studies showed that ethylene production in M. domestica increases 1000-fold post-harvest and cold-storage \citep{FernndezCancelo2022}, making it an ideal candidate as a post-harvest indicator. However, ET is highly volatile and is prone to stochastic changes from abiotic and biotic stresses \citep{Saltveit1999}, which can cause premature activation of our circuit. Therefore, a secondary ripening signal was introduced to enhance robustness to our circuit by providing redundancy and protecting activation from stochastic fluxes of ET.

The secondary phytohormones considered were auxin and gibberellins. Studies showed that auxin and ethylene have inter-dependent relationships featuring complex crosstalk. In apples, auxin has been shown to regulate ethylene in fruit ripening \citep{Yue2020}, while ET modulates auxin to restrict plant growth in Arabidopsis \citep{Vaseva2018}. GA on the other hand is unaffected by ethylene; exogenous treatment with ET does not reverse the ripening inhibition induced by GA \citep{Wu2023}. Additionally, GA accumulates during fruit growth and declines during ripening \citep{Lin2025,McAtee2013}. Put together, we decided to use the presence of ethylene and the absence of gibberellin as our indicator for post-harvest ripening.

To detect ethylene's presence, we decided to use PMdERF3, the promoter for ethylene response factor 3 (MdERF3) in M. domestica. Ethylene activates MdEIL1 to induce MdMYB1 and subsequently inducing MdERF3 \citep{Wang2022,An2018}. For Gibberellins, we decided to use PMdGA2ox6, a promoter for gibberellin 2 oxidase 6 in M. domestica. GA2ox family was found to be upregulated after GA treatment \citep{Zhang2019}. MdGA2ox6 was specifically found to be the most differentially expressed between 100 days after anthesis and harvest conditions \citep{Yan2024}.

\subsection{NIMPLY Gate}
To achieve activation when ET is high and GA is low, we implement a NOT-GA AND ET (NIMPLY) logic function (Figure 3). When both inputs are satisfied, the split GAL4 and VP16 fragments are expressed and associate via heterodimerising leucine zippers to reconstitute a functional activator for downstream expression.

Gibberellin induces the expression of TetR--SRDX--PEST via PMdGA2ox6, which binds TetO sites and, via its SRDX repression domain, inhibits GAL4 expression placed under the constitutive 35S promoter. The SRDX domain, derived from the plant EAR motif family, is a well-characterised and highly potent repressor in plants \citep{Markel2024}. EAR/SRDX domains have been shown to outperform non-EAR repression domains, including bacterial repressors like TetR, which on their own bind DNA but generally fail to recruit plant co-repressors efficiently \citep{Padidam2003}. Consequently, fusing SRDX to DNA-binding domains has been widely demonstrated to enhance repression strength in plants \citep{Szymczyk2024,Ferreira2024}. SRDX improves robustness of the NIMPLY gate by reducing stochastic derepression events. The PEST tag is a eukaryotic degradation signal that accelerates protein turnover and provides enhanced temporal control and reactivity of the circuit. This improves temporal precision, as without the PEST tag, inhibition by TetR--SRDX may persist even when gibberellin is absent. Ferreira et al.\ demonstrated that fusions of a bacterial DNA-binding repressor (FapR) with SRDX and PEST improve the efficiency of Boolean gate designs in plants \citep{Ferreira2024}. Together, these mechanisms minimise leaky expression of the NOT gate.

Once both VP16 and GAL4 are available, their association is catalysed by RR1234L and EE1234L, two halves of a synthetic heterodimerising leucine zipper. Crucially, RR1234L and EE1234L exhibit a low dissociation constant of \(K_D \approx 10^{-15}\,\mathrm{M}\), indicating an immediate and strong association \citep{EwenCampen2023,Moll2001}. This architecture allows the gate to operate predictably within the complex endogenous signalling environment of ripening fruit.

\subsection{Activator Module}
The activator module is made of high affinity UAS site upstream of a min35s promoter and GAL4-VP16 fusion activator, as shown in Figure 4A. The minimal 35s promoter are derived from Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35s promoter and it is known for its minimal to no expression \citep{Amack2020}. Furthermore, the min35s promoter has been shown to work in plants \citep{Engineer2005} and its dependencies on enhancers for expression \citep{Engineer2005}. The enhancer sequence used is from the UAS/GAL4 system which was also proven to work in plants \citep{Iacopino2022,Waki2012}. The specific high affinity UAS site used is of gal3 gene \citep{Donovan2019}. Self-amplification is activated by associated GAL4/VP16 inducing the expression of additional GAL4-VP16 fusion proteins. This feedback binarises ethylene signals upon reaching a threshold

\subsection{Repressor Module}
The repressor module regulates the system to generate pulse-like expression of the cassette module. It comprises a low affinity UAS site upstream to a min35s promoter regulating expression of LexA, which represses the cassette module, as shown in Figure 4B. The UAS site is derived from the fourth UAS tandem of gal10 gene and has a higher KD than the high affinity UAS site by 10-fold \citep{Donovan2019}. This reduced binding affinity introduces a delay in activation, ensuring that repression only engages after an initial phase of expression. LexA binds to LexA operator sites or SOS boxes to repress transcription in plants \citep{Zuo}. Crucially LexA is orthogonal to TetR, making it appropriate for our system. Repression strength can be further tuned by fusing LexA to the plant-derived SRDX repression domain or WRKY7 domain \citep{Kim2006,Hiratsu2003,Yagi2010}, enabling more efficient transcriptional silencing and lowering the output. Factors such as metabolic burden or product toxicity may require different repression strengths. Thus, the optimal strength of the repressor module depends on the specific cassette module. For our context, our modelling suggests including SRDX would be too strong, hence we chose LexA in isolation.

\subsection{Cassette Module}
The cassette module is positioned downstream of all regulatory elements and is fully interchangeable. For our proof-of-concept, shown in Figure 4C, the cassette encodes ADH1 and PDC, linked by an F2A peptide to enable polycistronic expression from a single transcript via ribosomal skipping \citep{Zhang2017}, resulting in approximately equimolar ADH1 and PDC. Modelling indicated that the expression of ADH1 and PDC led to uncontrolled ethanol production. However, addition of PEST tag to both ADH1 and PDC led to the accumulation of acetaldehyde which is highly toxic and carcinogenic \citep{Seitz2009}. Therefore, a PEST tag was added to PDC only to promote its degradation for controlled ethanol production without acetaldehyde accumulation.

\section{Assembly Method}
To assemble the level 0 parts in our circuit, we will be using Golden Braid (GB) 3.0 in Escherichia coli, before using Agrobacterium-mediated delivery into the in vivo host, Nicotiana Benthamiana.

GB 3.0 is a modular cloning system designed for rapid assembly of multiple gene parts specifically for genetic modification in plants, and benefits from established parts and vector library \citep{VazquezVilar2017}. We use E. coli as the standard propagation host for the GB vectors, grows quickly, gives high plasmid yields \citep{Fakruddin2013} and is straightforward to isolate verified constructs.

\subsection{Formatting of parts}

GB 3.0 constructs are made up of "levels". Level 0 are individual parts e.g. promoter, coding sequences (CDS), and terminator. Level 1 constructs are assembled from level 0 parts into transcriptional units (TU). Level 2 are multi-cassette constructs.

Each GB 3.0 level 0 part is formatted into plasmids according to the PhytoBrick standard where each part type (promoter, CDS, terminator) is flanked by specific type IIS restriction enzyme sites that generate overhangs, such that promoters are flanked by 5' GGAG and 3'AATG slots, CDS are flanked by 5'AATG and 3'GCTT slots, and terminators flanked by 5' GCTT and 3' CGCT, such that the 3' slot of one part is complementary to the next 5' slot \citep{SarrionPerdigones2013}. To prevent premature cutting, every part was screened for internal type IIS BsaI and BsmBI restriction sites.

Once formatted, part sequences can be obtained by PCR amplification or by DNA synthesis if required. Level 0 parts are then cloned into level 1 vectors, ready for downstream alpha and omega assembly into level 2.

\subsection{Assembly logic}

Unlike traditional cloning, our assembly approach follows the recursive logic of GB 3.0, which allows level~0 parts to be combined into complex multi-gene circuits using alternating Type IIS restriction enzymes (see Figure~5). Each assembled construct retains its terminal restriction sites, enabling further rounds of assembly. However, if the same enzyme were used in consecutive steps, it would cut previously assembled products. Therefore, by alternating enzymes and using matching vector overhangs, the integrity of each assembled module is maintained throughout the process.

Figure~5A illustrates how Level~1 vectors, prepared in the PhytoBrick format, are assembled into a pDGB1\_\(\alpha\) destination vector using \textit{BsaI}. This yields three separate plasmids: the sensor plasmid (\(\alpha 1\)), containing the circuit's sensing components; the feedback plasmid (\(\alpha 2\)), which holds regulatory elements; and the cargo plasmid (\(\alpha 3\)), carrying the interchangeable cassette. This modular design permits individual modification of any of \(\alpha 1\), \(\alpha 2\), or \(\alpha 3\) without the need to reassemble the entire construct.

Figure~5B depicts the \(\Omega\)-assembly step, where a second reaction using \textit{BsmBI} combines \(\alpha 1\) and \(\alpha 2\) into the pDGB1\_\(\Omega\) vector, resulting in the stable modular construct pCIDER\_\(\alpha\) that encodes the core circuitry of iCIDER.

Figure~5C shows the final integration step, in which either an \(\alpha 2\)-assembly or the \(\Omega\)-assembly product is merged with the cargo plasmid (\(\alpha 3\)) to produce a binary vector. This final binary vector is flanked by left and right border (LB/RB) T-DNA sequences required for \textit{Agrobacterium}-mediated plant transformation.

After each \(\alpha 2\)- or \(\Omega\)-assembly, \textit{E.~coli} transformants are plated on the antibiotic corresponding to the resistance marker in the destination backbone to select for correctly assembled constructs. Multiple colonies are then screened by colony PCR across the new junctions formed between Level~0 parts to confirm correct part order and orientation. Restriction digest profiling and Sanger sequencing are used to identify any mutations before the final binary vector is electroporated into \textit{Agrobacterium tumefaciens}.

\subsection{Invivo Characterisation}
Agrobacteria-mediated delivery is a well-established rapid protocol for genetic modification in plants \citep{Anami2013}. Wounded plant tissues induce the activation of virulence (vir) genes, which transfers LB/RB-flanked T-DNA into plant cells via the type IV bacterial secretion system \citep{Hamel2025}. For proof-of-concept, N. benthamiana will be used as our chassis as it is highly amenable to Agrobacterium-mediated agroinfiltration delivery \citep{Beritza2024}. Following validation, the system will be translated to M. domestica, from which stable transgenic lines will be made, enabling evaluation in apples. Finally, ethanol production will be quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) \citep{Neelamegam2012} using Imperial's facilities. This helps us validate circuit function and gene expression.
