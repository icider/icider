description: Format references in the references.bib file

When taking @blah and converting that to @citep{blah}. If that reference isn't present in the references.bib file, keep the @blah.

- if a link is present, use https://www.doi2bib.org/bib to generate the bibtex entry and add it to the references.bib file.
- if no link is present, leave it as it is.
